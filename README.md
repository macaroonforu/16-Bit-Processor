# 16-Bit-Processor
A CPU designed with Verilog, featuring general purpose registers, a stack pointer, a link register, a program counter, and an ALU, all of which are controlled by a finite-state machine. The processor supports memory read/writes as well as subroutines. Additionally, a game that interacts with the LED switches and HEX Display on the development board was written in assembly language to be run using the instruction set provided by the processor.
