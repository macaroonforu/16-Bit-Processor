# 16-Bit-Processor

A processor written in System Verilog with general purpose registers, a stack pointer, a link register, a program counter, and an ALU, which are controlled by a finite-state machine. The processor supports memory read/writes as well as subroutines. Additionally, a game that interacts with the LED switches and HEX Display on the FPGA was written in ARM-A9 assembly to run on the processor.
